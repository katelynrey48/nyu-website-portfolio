            Hello! My name is Katelyn, I am a software development major at the Highschool of Fashion Industries in New York City.
            </p> 
            <p>
                I love to create many things, illustrating, writing, and crafting. I have many hobbies, but my current favorites are playing Dungeons and Dragons and reading. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am passionate about many social justice issues and hope that my work will leave users thinking more thoughtfully about our society.
            </p>

    On December 15th 2025 I visited the IMA/ITP capstone with the software development majors at HSFI. Seeing the students projects confirmed what I had been looking for, a program that combines technology and art. Experiencing work I could interact with, and how others responded to it,  made me realize this is the kind of work I want to pursue. NYU IMA offers the opportunities I didn’t have in high school, and I’m excited to grow as both a developer and an artist there.
<p></p>
Being in New York City is also essential to my artistic voice. The city’s energy and diversity shape how I think and create. NYU IMA offers the perfect environment for me to combine my STEM skills with my artistic vision and develop into the kind of artist I aspire to be.
