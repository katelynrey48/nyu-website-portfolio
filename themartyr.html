  An 80s-inspired text-based hack-and-slash adventure following a woman raised by her church to destroy a vampire blamed for her village’s disappearances. Trained from childhood, she storms his castle, battles his three wives, and finally confronts the Count himself, only to learn the church betrayed her, and that she was groomed to be his next wife. With multiple endings and a definitive “true” one, the game explores themes of coercion, control, and survival, using gothic horror to raise awareness about domestic violence. Inspired by ‘Dracula’ and ‘A Dowry of Blood’.
